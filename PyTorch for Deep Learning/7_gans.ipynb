    "Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs use neural networks for **generative modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

    "There are two neural networks: a *Generator* and a *Discriminator*. \n",
    "- The **generator** generates a \"fake\" sample given a random vector/matrix\n",
    "- the **discriminator** attempts to detect whether a given sample is \"real\" (picked from the training data) or \"fake\" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: the discriminator is trained for a few epochs, then the generator is trained for a few epochs, and repeat. \n",

    "GANs can be very difficult to train, and are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, activation functions and regularization. \n",

    "Notice that generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task: the images do not have any labels. "
